SX250H Summer Trim CDU Power-on DCDC/OBC Entering Standby Instead of Initialization Analysis Report

Problem Statement
At power-on, the DCDC/OBC components report a 'Standby' status instead of the required 'Initial' state.
Containment
Root Cause Identification / Failure Analysis
Software status transitioned within 10 ms, and is significantly faster than the DCDC/OBC report cycle time of 100 ms. By then, the status was already at “standby”.
In addition, what the communication matrix requested was the initial value of “initial”, instead of the current status from DCDC/OBC. There was a gap in the understanding of the design team.
Corrective Action
Modified software to force the first message frame to report the 'Initial' value regardless of current state machine status. Updated the software on the affected units.
Validation
Verified by test engineers; first-frame status now correctly reports as 'Initial' as per the vehicle communication matrix.
Preventative Action
Added specific test cases for first-frame status reporting. Added requirements, and software management support documentations.
