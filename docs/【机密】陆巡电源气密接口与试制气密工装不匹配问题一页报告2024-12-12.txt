SX250H Project 陆巡 Power Supply Airtight Interface and Trial Production Airtight Tooling Mismatch Analysis and Rectification Report

Problem Statement
The 陆巡 power supply airtight interface is incompatible with the trial production airtight tooling. Consequently, it is impossible to perform airtightness testing on the power supply cavity of the 7-in-1 assembly.
Containment
The current batch of products has been accepted under concession. This decision was based on the fact that the 陆巡 power supply is a "black box" purchased part that underwent internal airtightness testing by the supplier before shipping.
Root Cause Identification / Failure Analysis
R&D failed to send the trial production airtight plug to 陆巡 for matching design and neglected to perform data verification related to the assembly process.
Corrective Action
Design Adjustment: 陆巡 was notified to adjust the position of the ventilation hole. Integration: The trial production airtight plug was sent to 陆巡 to ensure a matching design for future iterations. The interfering screw was moved farther away from the airtight tooling interface.
Validation
Updated 3D CAD and physical verification demonstrate that the airtight tooling can now be plugged and unplugged correctly.
Preventative Action
R&D must provide trial production airtight plugs or detailed interface data to suppliers like 陆巡 during the design phase. Include process-related tooling compatibility checks in the standard R&D data verification checklist.
