Thermal Deformation of SX250H Power Supply Copper Bar Plastic Housing
Problem Statement
When: 2024/09/30
Where: Production assembly
During the offline testing of the electric drive, the copper power rail’s plastic housing was melted and deformed.
Vendor: 陆巡科技
Failed component batch: 2438

Containment
Issued replacement plastic housing for all problematic downstream shipments.
Internally returned problematic semi-finished and finished goods for rework.

Root Cause Identification / Failure Analysis
The plastic housing of the battery copper bar partially melted upon coming into contact with the battery connector’s OT terminus.
During reproduction, both the copper bar and the OT terminus were both connected and at 110℃, close to the heat deflection temperature of the plastic housing, resulting in deformation.
The plastic housing material was polyoxymethylene (POM) with a heat deflection temperature (HDT) of 130℃, a long term max operating temperature of 100℃ and a short term max operating temperature of 150℃, a melting point of 165℃. The material was unfit for the use case.
Did not thoroughly review the supplier’s bill of materials (BOM).
Quality control did not account for long term usage.
No particular testing item for this failure mode.

Corrective Action
Control material choice for critical upstream components.
Change the plastic housing to PPS instead of POM.

Validation

Preventative Measures
More thorough review of the supplier’s BOM.
